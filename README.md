# Relativity TransferSDK Samples

## Introduction

This project showcases a straightforward integration scenario with `Relativity.Transfer.SDK` (a.k.a `TransferSDK`) NuGet package.

#### `TransferSDK` lets you:
- Upload a single directory or file to the selected destination in RelativityOne fileshare
- Download a single directory or file from the selected source in RelativityOne fileshare
- Upload a directory (using an existing job based destination path) to the RelativityOne fileshare
- Download a directory (using an existing job based source path) from the RelativityOne fileshare
- Track the overall progress of the transfer
- Track the progress of individual items that have been transferred, failed, or skipped
- Get a detailed transfer report
- Setup one of three predefined retry policies - No Retry, Linear, Exponential 
- Assing an exclusion policy to filter out unwanted files

The library supports `.NETStandard 2.0`, which means it is cross-platform. You can run it on Windows or Linux!

## Samples
#### Repository structure:
The repository contains 3 projects:
- `Relativity.Transfer.SDK.Samples.Core` - contains all the interfaces, models, UI, and helpers used by the `Relativity.Transfer.SDK.Samples.Repository` project.
- `Relativity.Transfer.SDK.Samples.Repository` - contains all the samples.
- `Relativity.Transfer.SDK.Samples.CLI` - contains a command-line interface for the `Relativity.Transfer.SDK.Samples.Repository` project. It uses IoC container to create instances of required classes.

#### Examples structure:
- All code presenting a particular example is contained only in a single file (if additional dependencies are required they are injected by IoC).
- Usually, all necessary inputs are taken at the beginning of the example using `IConfigurationScreen` implementation.
- Implementation of `IConfigurationScreen` interface prompts a user for every input, but when value is not provided the default value is used (the default value is shown in bracket alongside with prompt, it can be set via `appsettings.json` file).
- Sample code contains accurate comments describing the flow.
- Two types of workflows are supported by samples:
    - **FullPathWorkflow** - consists of samples which requires a source and destination paths to be provided.
    - **JobBasedWorkflow** - consists of samples which requires a source path (upload) or destination path (download) to be provided. The other path is taken from an existing job.

## Running the sample

- Sample is a regular Visual Studio solution (it is recommended to use Visual Studio >= 2019)
- The settings also can be modified at runtime. They are stored (except the password) in the application's `appsettings.json` file, in the `bin` folder. 
- Whenever the application is rebuilt, the bin `appsettings.json` file is restored to the values from `appsettings.json` file from the repository.
- It is advised to manually remove the `obj` folder and rebuild the solution in order to apply `appsettings.json` file changes into the `bin` config file.
- Directly modifying the `appsettings.json` file in Visual Studio keeps these settings between rebuilds.
- The settings to fill up at application start-up:
    - `Common.ClientName` - This is required to identify the owner of a job. Can be any string.
    - `Common.InstanceUrl`- The URL to the Relativity instance. Example: `https://contoso.relativity.one`
    - `Common.FileShareRoot` - The root of the Relativity fileshare. Example: `\\files.contoso.pod.r1.kcura.com\contoso`
        - Note: This value can be taken from Relativity. Find the `Servers` tab, filter it by `Fileshare`, search for the specified one, and copy its `UNC` path value **without** the `\Files\` suffix.
        - **Note**: It is crucial to remember that backslash `\` characters should be escaped using a double backslash `\\` (this is required by json file to properly deserialize a path).
    - `Common.FileShareRelativePath` - The location where the files are transferred relative to the root of the fileshare.
        - **Note**: `<transfer job id>` folder is created in provided location.
        - **Note**: Provided path can not have `\` at the beginning.
        - The path must be rooted in one of the core folders that reside on the fileshare (like Files, Temp, etc.)
        - **Note**: It is crucial to remember that backslash `\` characters should be escaped using a double backslash `\\` (this is required by json file to properly deserialize a path).
    - `Common.OAuthCredentials` - The OAuth2 secret ID and secret used to authenticate in RelativityOne (Find the `OAuth2 Client` tab, then find the user and copy `ClientId` and `ClientSecret` fileds).
- The sttings specified for a sample are commented in `appsettings.json` file. Which section is responsible for which sample is described in the table above.

## Authentication
- First, the transfer client object has to be created, which is used to manage transfers:
```cs
// FullPathWorkflow
var transferClient = TransferClientBuilder.FullPathWorkflow
    .WithAuthentication(authenticationProvider)
    .WithClientName(clientName)
    .Build();

// or JobBasedWorkflow
var transferClient = TransferClientBuilder.FullPathWorkflow
    .WithAuthentication(authenticationProvider)
    .WithClientName(clientName)
    .Build();
```

- `TransferSKD` uses a bearer token in order to authenticate the transfer.
- To pass the token, the `Relativity.Transfer.SDK.Interfaces.Authentication.IRelativityAuthenticationProvider` must be implemented and an instance should be passed to the client. Sample implementation of authentication provider is [here](https://github.com/relativitydev/relativity-transfer-sdk-samples/blob/main/Source/Relativity.Transfer.SDK.Samples.Core/Authentication/RelativityAuthenticationProvider.cs). 
- In order to get the token, [Bearer token authentication](https://platform.relativity.com/RelativityOne/Content/REST_API/REST_API_authentication.htm#_Bearer_token_authentication) is used, which requires user's OAuth2 client id and client's secret. (see [SampleBearerTokenRetriver](https://github.com/relativitydev/relativity-transfer-sdk-samples/blob/main/Source/Relativity.Transfer.SDK.Samples.Core/Authentication/BearerTokenRetriever.cs))
    - The token can become obsolete after some time. It's the `IRelativityAuthenticationProvider` responsibility to always return a valid token.
- Client id and secret can be read from the RelativityOne instance. It is under the `Oauth2 Client` tab. Appropriate users can be identified by the `Context User` column.
    - The secret is valid for only a limited period of time (8 hours by default), so it is advised to regenerate it before copying.
- It is strongly recommended to implement your own authentication mechanism which best suits your needs. Here are some helpful links: 
    - [Relativity REST API authentication](https://platform.relativity.com/RelativityOne/Content/REST_API/REST_API_authentication.htm)
    - [OAuth2 clients](https://platform.relativity.com/10.3/Content/Authentication/OAuth2_clients.htm#_OAuth2_Client_Manager_REST_service)

## Contributing

- We welcome contributions!
- To add a new sample, create a new class in the appropriate workflow folder in `Relativity.Transfer.SDK.Samples.Repository` project (or create a new folder if a new workflow is used).
- The sample calss should implement [Relativity.Transfer.SDK.Samples.Core.Runner.ISample](https://github.com/relativitydev/relativity-transfer-sdk-samples/blob/main/Source/Relativity.Transfer.SDK.Samples.Core/Runner/ISample.cs) interface.
- Add [Relativity.Transfer.SDK.Samples.Core.Attributes.SampleAttribute](https://github.com/relativitydev/relativity-transfer-sdk-samples/blob/main/Source/Relativity.Transfer.SDK.Samples.Core/Attributes/SampleAttribute.cs) to a class which describes the sample. The most important parameter is `TransferType` which specifies which configuration section is used to provide default parameters.
- Whatever you need, should be requested by `.ctor(...)` because the sample is created by IoC container.
- Your sample should be visible in the CLI application.

## Exceptions 
Some exceptions that can be encountered when using samples and their potential root causes

#### System.Net.WebException: The remote name could not be resolved:
- sample console output: 
```
Exception occurred during execution of the transfer. Look at the inner exception for more details.
Relativity.Transfer.SDK.Interfaces.Exceptions.TransferJobExecutionException: Exception occurred during execution of the transfer. Look at the inner exception for more details. ---> Relativity.Transfer.SDK.Interfaces.Exceptions.UnauthorizedException: Unable to retrieve the authentication token. Check inner exception for details. ---> System.ApplicationException: Failed to retrieve credentials. ---> System.ApplicationException: Failed to retrieve bearer token. ---> System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: An error occurred while sending the request. ---> System.Net.WebException: The remote name could not be resolved: 'reg-b.r1.kcurdda.com'
```
- Reasons: 
    - Wrong RelativityOneInstanceUrl value. 
    - Relativity instance is not available 

#### Relativity.Transfer.SDK.Interfaces.Exceptions.UnauthorizedException:
- sample console output: 
```
Exception occurred during execution of the transfer. Look at the inner exception for more details.
Relativity.Transfer.SDK.Interfaces.Exceptions.TransferJobExecutionException: Exception occurred during execution of the transfer. Look at the inner exception for more details. ---> Relativity.Transfer.SDK.Interfaces.Exceptions.UnauthorizedException: Unable to retrieve the authentication token. Check inner exception for details. ---> System.InvalidOperationException: API call 'ReadAsync' failed with status code: 'Unauthorized' Details: ''.
```
- Reasons: 
    - wrong password/credentials/client ID

#### Relativity.Transfer.SDK.Interfaces.Exceptions.BackendServiceException: Forbidden
- sample console output:
